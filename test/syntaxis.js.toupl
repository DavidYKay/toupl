Hello! This full test for Toupl v 0.9
Text Oriented Universal Programming Language

/%
First, you must know how write a comments. This is block comment
%/
//% And this is line comment

This is varable %simpleVarable%
Also can content dufficult evolution %Math.sin(1+3)*Math.tan(5)%

[%This text outputed, if &%varable00%& is not equalent null%]

[%This text outputed, if &%varable00%& is not equalent null and &%varable01%& is not equalent null%]

[%This text outputed, if &%varable00%& is not equalent null, but this %varable03% not affect to text output%]

?%alert("Code Include - language specific code you can put in those construction")%?

//% some examples with code include 
Complex structure #1
?%if(a==2)
  {%?
a is eq 2
?%}
  else
  {%?
a not eq 2
?%}%?

Complex structure #2
?%if(a==2)
  {%?
a is eq 2
?%}
  else
  {%?
a not eq 2, but eq %a%
?%}%?

Complex structure #3
?%for(var i=0;i<10;++i)
  {%?
i is %i%
?%}%?

!%But how can you write text that contain toupl specific tags such as
/% block comment %/ but this comment will be print %)
//% and line comment too
?% even codeinclude! %?
and %varable%
and if construction [% &%varable07%& %]
We don`t foget leave you ability to write even so super tags! Please !% %!%!(must be twice) :)
%!
And this super tag worg everywere
?% alert("In code. 100!%%%!") %?
%("In varable. !%@%_%@%!"+"this for coplexy").indexOf("complexy")%
[% In if !%/%realy shown comment%/%! &%"!%//% and this too%!"%&% ]
